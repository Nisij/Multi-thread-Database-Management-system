# Multi-thread-Database-Management-system
Familiarize with the use of pthreads, pthread mutex semaphores, and pthread condition variables. 

 A multithreaded database management system receives requests from multiple users to access a database with ten data records. The DBMS uses concurrency mechanisms to guarantee consistency when multiples requests try to access the same data record at the same time. One of the features of the DBMS is an accounting module that prints all the information regarding how the requests from the clients are being processed by the DBMS. The goal is to simulate the operation of the DBMS using POSIX threads, POSIX semaphores, and condition variables.
